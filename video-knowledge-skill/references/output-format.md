# Output Format

## metadata.json

Contains source, platform, title, author, URL, local asset path, and extractor metadata.

Sources that expose only metadata or preview text must fail before summary generation. For example, WeChat Channels preview pages without playable media are rejected instead of producing placeholder notes.

## transcript.json

```json
{
  "language": "zh",
  "duration": 123.45,
  "segments": [
    {"start": 0.0, "end": 3.2, "text": "..."}
  ]
}
```

## transcript.md

Timestamped transcript.

## summary.md

Structured Markdown knowledge document. The default `dual` style contains:

- `A. 忠实摘要`
- `B. 可收藏笔记`

Use `--summary-style faithful` or `--summary-style note` to generate only one layer.

Summarization writes two Markdown files:

- `summary.md`: stable compatibility filename.
- `{主标题}.md`: title-based filename derived from the first `# ` heading, for human browsing and Obsidian-style note names.

When answering the user after a successful summarization, include the absolute `summary.md` path, the title-based Markdown path, and paste the full Markdown content. The path alone is not enough unless the user explicitly asks for paths only.

## Obsidian export

When a local Obsidian installation is detected, `summary.md` is copied into an automatically selected two-level category folder at the vault root by default, such as `研发/DevOps/标题.md` or `AI工程/Agent/标题.md`. The primary category is selected by an LLM from the fixed category list; if the model is unavailable, the exporter falls back to local keyword rules. The exported note also includes an `## Obsidian 关联` section with wiki links to flat topic notes under `主题/`, for example `主题/研发 SOP.md` or `主题/AI工程 Agent.md`. When an article spans domains, related categories are linked as additional topics so Obsidian graph view can show cross-domain relationships. Detection order:

1. `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`, if set and valid.
2. The open or most recent vault in `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/obsidian.json`.

Use `OBSIDIAN_OUTPUT_DIR` to place category folders under a chosen vault subdirectory, `OBSIDIAN_CATEGORY` to force one category path for a run, `OBSIDIAN_CLASSIFIER=rules` to disable model classification, or `--no-obsidian` to disable export. When export succeeds, `metadata.json` includes `obsidian_path`, `obsidian_category`, `obsidian_category_method`, `obsidian_category_reason`, and `obsidian_related_categories`. Metadata also includes `summary_path` and `summary_named_path`.

Both `summary.md` and the title-based Markdown file include a final `## 原链接` section with the original input URL or local source path. Obsidian exports preserve this source block and append `## Obsidian 关联` after it.

Supported category paths:

- `研发/前端`, `研发/DevOps`, `研发/工程质量`, `研发/架构`, `研发/SOP`
- `AI工程/Agent`, `AI工程/Skill`, `AI工程/Harness`, `AI工程/AI Coding`
- `管理/团队协作`, `管理/流程治理`, `管理/CodeReview`
- `设计/产品设计`, `设计/UIUX`
- `生活/阅读`, `生活/摄影`, `生活/旅行`, `生活/杂谈`
